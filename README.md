# Text Analytics Web App with Persistent Storage

This project showcases a sophisticated text analytics web application built with Flask and powered by Azure's Text Analytics API. It empowers users to perform in-depth text analysis, including sentiment analysis, entity recognition, linked entity recognition, key phrase extraction, and language detection.  Crucially, it persists these results in a SQLite database, enabling valuable historical analysis and review.

This application isn't just a technical demo; it's a powerful tool with real-world business applications. Imagine a customer service dashboard that not only analyzes incoming messages in real-time but also lets agents explore past customer sentiment, key entities, and trending topics.  This project provides the foundation for such a system, ready for expansion and integration.
